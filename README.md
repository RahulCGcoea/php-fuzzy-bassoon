I have created login system using php having basic functionality such as login user and take to welcome page if user_type is "student" otherwise if user type is "admin" take user to xammp phpadmin page. There is also a registration form to self-register a new user on system by default user_type will be "student". Further, it has forgot password functionality using security question and security answer. also there is logout functionality on welcome page to logout user by destroying session.
